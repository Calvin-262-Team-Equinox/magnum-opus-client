#Magnum Opus: collaborative painting
Jahn Davis, Hannah Ludema, Micah Ng, Casey Jones

Our vision is a collaborative painting application in which a user can paint on a canvas that can be updated in real time and accessed 
by other "painters" who would be invited to collaborate with you on your artistic masterpiece. This app would be a great way to pass time with friends and connect with others as well as allow people to express themselves creatively. This is unlike any other app on the market in that the only app that is similar in respects to being able to paint collaboratively only allows people on the same wifi network to collaborate. 

Magnum Opus will allow multiple people to paint on the same screen. In addition, it will have multiple canvases connected together to support various screen sizes as well as have infinitely large paintings. Furthermore, it will feature various size brush strokes as well as multiple colors and the ability to import pictures to draw on.
