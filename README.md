#Magnum Opus: Collaborative Painting App

Our vision is a collaborative painting application in which a user can paint on a canvas which can be updated in real time and accessed by other "painters" who would be invited to collaborate with you on your artistic masterpiece. This app would be a great way to pass time with friends as well as allow people to express themselves creatively. This is unlike any other app on the market as the only other app that offers collaborative painting restricts users to the same wifi network to collaborate on an artwork.

Magnum Opus will allow multiple people to paint on the same screen. It will have multiple canvases connected together to support various screen sizes as well as have infinitely large paintings. It will also feature various size brush strokes as well as multiple colors and the ability to import pictures to draw on.
