##Supplemental Specification

In addition to having a functional program that allows users to collaboratively draw pictures with other users, there are some nonfunctional requirements for our system. Our system should run on android and use a data server that runs on Java/Jersey/Unix. In addition, it should save images in png file format. Furthermore, the program must be responsive and should update in real time so that users can draw collaboratively. Moreover, the app should be easy to learn and easy for the user to navigate.
