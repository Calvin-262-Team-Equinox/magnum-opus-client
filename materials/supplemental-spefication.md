##Supplemental Specification

In addition to having a working program that allows users to collaboratively draw pictures with other users, there are some 
nonfunctional requirements for our system. For our system we want our users to be able to scroll left and right, and zoom in 
and out so that they can navagate around their cnvas, add small details, and view their whole creation. In addition, normal 
users will be limited to a certain number of tiles in order to allow for enough storage space. However, in order to allow for 
an “infinitely” large canvas, users should able to purchase more tile space. Furthermore, we want our users to be able to upload
pictures onto their canvas so that they can add to those pictures, use them as stencils, color them in, and so forth.
